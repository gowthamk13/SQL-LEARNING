# SQL Learning & Advanced Query Practice

This repository contains my complete SQL learning journey, including database setup, data insertion scripts, fundamental queries, and advanced SQL concepts.  
The goal is to build strong SQL problem-solving skills and practice writing industry-level queries used in real data engineering, backend development, and analytics roles.

## 📌 Overview

This project is built around a simple Student–Course–Enrollment database schema.  
Using this structure, I practiced a wide range of SQL operations from beginner to advanced levels.

The scripts include:
- Table creation and schema design  
- Data population  
- Basic SELECT queries  
- JOIN operations  
- Aggregations  
- CTEs  
- Window Functions  
- Recursive queries  
- JSON aggregation  
- Conditional expressions  
- Real-world reporting queries
